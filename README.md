magento-ceicomextends-ibanners
==============================
This Magento extension improves and includes a widget to work along with the extension called "iBanners" by FishPig. See its [Magento Connect Page](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/ibanners.html) for details.

Set a group or select which banners will be displayed by the widget. You can define a start and a end date to show the banners when the widget is configured to display them by group. It's possible to show a countdown that can be customized from your own css.
